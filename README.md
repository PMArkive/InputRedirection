Shinyquagsire for inspiring me to start this with his writeup, then helping me along the way

## how do i use this
Install the input_proc cia on your 3ds, then run the injector.

use one of these input programs to actually get input to the ds:
* [SDL for Linux](https://github.com/Stary2001/InputClient-SDL)
* [XInput for Windows](https://github.com/Kazo/InputRedirectionClient)

**NTR Debugger must be enabled!**
