# limitations
i don't hook the IR service, so no zl/zr or c-stick

## credits and stuff
Memory patching code taken from BootNTR

Shinyquagsire for inspiring me to start this with his writeup, then helping me along the way

## how do i use this
Install InputRedirection.cia or InputRedirection_mode3.cia (for extended-memory games on o3ds), then run.

use one of these clients to actually get input to the 3ds:
* [SDL for Linux](https://github.com/Stary2001/InputClient-SDL)
* [XInput for Windows](https://github.com/Kazo/InputRedirectionClient)

**NTR Debugger must be enabled!**
